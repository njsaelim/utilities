# CMIP6-Bash-script

This powershell script will go to each subfolder in the 'data' folder and bash wget files inside each subfolder. All you need to do is to put selected wget files from https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/ in your subfolders of choice under 'data' folder. (You may need to press 'Enter' when it asks for OpenID and password.)
